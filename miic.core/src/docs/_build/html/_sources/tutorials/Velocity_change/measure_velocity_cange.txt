Measure Velocity change
=======================

************
Introduction
************

After the computation of noise correaltion functions these are available for further analysis for example to estimate changes of the seismic velocity. This is implemented in the :download:`calculate_noise_correlations module <../../../miic/scripts/calculate_noise_correlations.py>`. It uses the :func:`~miic.scripts.measure_velocity_change`
