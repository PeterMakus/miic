Introduction
************

The `MIIC Software Suite <http://theo1.geo.uni-leipzig.de/trac>`_ is a library of python functions for data processing in seismic interferometry. It features a graphic user interface based on the Enthought `BlockCanvas <http://code.enthought.com/projects/block_canvas/>`_ Project. The MIIC suit is created within the `BMBF <http://www.bmbf.de/>`_ funded research and development project on *Monitoring and Imaging based on Interferometric Concepts* `MIIC <http://theo1.geo.uni-leipzig.de>`_.

In this tutorial we explain the use of the GUI in parallel to the command line functions.

Correlation Function
********************

BC implementation
=================
The most fundamental operation in seismic interferometry is the correlation of seismic records. In the most simple case
one wishes to correalte two time series. This is implemented in the BC project described in the following section.

The project consist of two :class:`~miic.core.alpha_mod.stream_read` blocks that take a filename as input and deliver an :class:`~obspy.core.stream.Stream` object. 
These two objects are combined in the :class:`~miic.core.stream.stream_combine` block. The variable ``st11`` now is a stream that contains two traces 
which are passed to the :class:`~miic.core.corr_fun.corr_trace_fun` block that correalates the traces in the stream. In case the stream contains 
many traces it is handy to be able to specify the combinations of the traces that are to be correlated. This feature is 
provided by the ``combinations`` block that outputs a list of tuples to :class:`~miic.core.corr_fun.corr_trace_fun` block. The output of ``Corr_trace_fun``
is again a stream that contains as much correlation functions as combinations are passed. :class:`~miic.core.corr_fun.corr_trace_fun` modifies the
metainformation in the stream to be appropriate for a correlation function. The stream can either be plotted or saved.
Because of the modified metainformation the stanard seismological dataformats are not suitable to store the stream of
correlation functions. The :class:`~miic.core.miic_utils.convert_to_matlab` function provides the possibility to save the individual 
traces in a stream into individual ``matlab.mat`` files together with the required metainformation.

Python Code
===========
The project implemented above can be exported as the following python code.
